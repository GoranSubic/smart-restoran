<h2>Find the perfect recipe - Caribian cuisines</h2>


<p>Caribbean cuisine is a fusion of African, Amerindian, European, East Indian, Arab and Chinese cuisine.</p>
<p>These traditions were brought from many different countries when they came to the Caribbean. In addition,
    the population has created styles that are unique to the region.</p>
<p>Ingredients which are common in most islands' dishes are rice, plantains, beans, cassava, cilantro (coriander),
    bell peppers, chickpeas, tomatoes, sweet potatoes, coconut, and any of various meats that are locally available like
    beef, poultry, pork or fish. </p>
<p>A characteristic seasoning for the region is a green herb and oil based marinade which imparts a flavor profile
    which is quintessentially Caribbean in character. Ingredients may include garlic, onions, scotch bonnet peppers,
    celery, green onions, and herbs like cilantro, marjoram, rosemary, tarragon and thyme. This green seasoning is used
    for a variety of dishes like curries, stews and roasted meats.</p>
